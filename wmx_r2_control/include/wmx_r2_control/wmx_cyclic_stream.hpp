// Streams per-cycle absolute position commands to a group of WMX3 axes through
// the CyclicBuffer module, so that a continuously updated joint target (MoveIt
// Servo, a teleop device) can drive the arm. Contrast StartCSplinePos, which
// needs the whole trajectory up front and cannot be blended into.
//
// Lifecycle, mapped onto the ros2_control hardware component:
//     open()     on_configure/on_activate  -- allocates; never in the loop
//     start()    on_activate               -- seeds a hold, then Execute
//     push()     write()                   -- one command per cycle
//     abort()    on_deactivate             -- immediate stop, buffer cleared
//     close()    on_cleanup                -- deallocates
//
// push() polls the buffer itself, so a running stream needs exactly one engine
// round-trip per control cycle. Do NOT also call refresh() from read(): that
// would double the polling in the real-time loop for no new information.
//
// All the timing arithmetic lives in cyclic_stream_timing.hpp, which is free of
// WMX types and unit-tested; this class is the WMX contact surface only.

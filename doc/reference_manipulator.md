# Manipulator Reference

The manipulator stack is four standalone rclcpp lifecycle nodes
(`wmx_r2_package/src/joint_state_broadcaster.cpp`,
`joint_trajectory_controller.cpp`, `joint_position_controller.cpp`,
`gripper_controller.cpp`) that sit on top of the general WMX nodes and expose the
MoveIt2 contract: a `FollowJointTrajectory` action in, `/joint_states` out, plus a
streaming (servo) path and a gripper service. Each attaches to the WMX3 device
itself and talks to CoreMotion / AdvancedMotion / IO directly — the general nodes
own the engine, not the motion these controllers command.

| Node | Role | Launched by |
|---|---|---|
| `joint_state_broadcaster` | Encoder feedback → `/joint_states`; clears amp alarms and switches servos on at activate | CR3A, CR5A |
| `joint_trajectory_controller` | `FollowJointTrajectory` action → WMX3 time-based C-spline | CR3A, CR5A |

## Parameters

All parameters are read **once at node construction** (`setRosParameter()`); there
is no parameter-set callback. A runtime `ros2 param set` is accepted by rclcpp but
has no effect on behaviour — restart the node to apply new values.

Unlike the differential-drive controller, the defaults here are **deliberate
non-values**: topic/action names default to `/<name>/no_param` and the axis lists
default to empty, so an unconfigured node is loud and inert rather than silently
wrong. Every deployment supplies a YAML.

### A. `joint_state_broadcaster`

| Parameter | Type | Default | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `joint_axes` | int[] | `[]` | – | WMX3 axis index per joint, in the same order as `joint_name`. **Not validated**: an out-of-range index reads out of bounds in the status array (garbage feedback), not an error. |
| `joint_name` | string[] | `[j1..j6]` | – | Joint names published in `JointState.name`. **Must be at least as long as `joint_axes`** — the publish loop indexes `joint_name[i]` for every entry of `joint_axes`, so a short list is out-of-bounds access, not a warning. |
| `joint_feedback_rate` | int | `0` | Hz | Feedback publish rate. The timer period is `1000 / joint_feedback_rate` truncated to whole milliseconds, so prefer rates that divide 1000 (100, 125, 200, 250, 500). **The default is not usable**: leaving it at `0` divides by zero at `configure`. Always set it (both shipped configs use `100`). |
| `encoder_joint_topic` | string | `/encoder_joint_topic/no_param` | – | Real-robot feedback topic; the deployment sets it to `/joint_states` (MoveIt / robot_state_publisher input). |
| `isaacsim_joint_topic` | string | `/isaacsim_joint_topic/no_param` | – | Mirror of the same message for Isaac Sim (`/isaacsim/joint_command`). Published **before** the header stamp is filled in, i.e. with a zero stamp — Isaac consumes positions by name, not by time. |
| `gazebo_joint_topic` | string | `/gazebo_joint_topic/no_param` | – | Positions only, as `Float64MultiArray`, for a Gazebo position controller. |
| `gripper_joint_name` | string[] | `[]` | – | Extra joint names appended to the feedback message so the gripper shows up in RViz/MoveIt. Empty = no gripper (CR5A). |
| `gripper_address` | int[2] | `[0, 0]` | – | `[byte, bit]` of the WMX **output** bit read back for gripper state. |
| `gripper_open_value` | double | `0.0` | m or rad | Joint value reported for every `gripper_joint_name` while the output bit is 0. |
| `gripper_close_value` | double | `0.0` | m or rad | Joint value reported while the bit is 1. CR3A uses `0.045`. |

### B. `joint_trajectory_controller`

| Parameter | Type | Default | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `joint_axes` | int[] | `[]` | – | WMX3 axis index per trajectory joint, positionally matched to the goal's `joint_names`. The goal's names are **logged, not matched** — the i-th position in the goal drives `joint_axes[i]`. Ordering agreement with the planner is a deployment responsibility. |
| `joint_trajectory_action` | string | `/joint_trajectory_action/no_param` | – | Name of the `FollowJointTrajectory` action server. Must equal the controller name MoveIt2 is configured to call (e.g. `/movensys_manipulator_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory`). |

`MAX_TRAJ_POINTS` (1000) is a compile-time constant, not a parameter: it sizes the
WMX spline buffer allocated at `configure` and caps the accepted goal length.

### C. `joint_position_controller`

| Parameter | Type | Default | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `joint_axes` | int[] | `[]` | – | WMX3 axis index per joint. |
| `joint_name` | string[] | `[j1..j6]` | – | Name→axis map used when the incoming `JointTrajectory` carries `joint_names`; pairs positionally with `joint_axes`. An unknown name drops the message (throttled warn). With empty `joint_names` the message is taken positionally. |
| `joint_trajectory_topic` | string | `/joint_trajectory_topic/no_param` | – | Streamed trajectory input from MoveIt Servo (e.g. `/movensys_manipulator_arm_controller/joint_trajectory`). |
| `default_velocity` | double | `0.1` | user-unit/s | Per-axis velocity used when the point's `time_from_start` is 0 (no time base to derive a velocity from). Deployments use `0.5`. |
| `accel_ratio` | double | `0.5` | – | Fraction of the step time spent accelerating: `acc = velocity / (accel_ratio · dt)`. Lower = harder ramp. Deployments use `0.3`. Not guarded: `0` yields a non-finite acceleration. |
| `min_step` | double | `0.1` | user-unit | Deadband. A message whose largest per-axis move from the current *command* position is below this is dropped, so servo jitter does not restart an interpolation every cycle. Deployments use `0.001` — the default is deliberately coarse. |

### D. `gripper_controller`

| Parameter | Type | Default | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wmx_gripper_topic` | string | `/wmx_gripper_topic/no_param` | – | Name of the `std_srvs/SetBool` **service** (the parameter is named "topic" for historical reasons). CR3A uses `/wmx/set_gripper`. |
| `gripper_address` | int[2] | `[0, 0]` | – | `[byte, bit]` of the WMX output bit driven by the service. Both entries are read unconditionally, so a list shorter than 2 is out-of-bounds access. |

`MANIPULATOR_MODEL` is an **environment variable**, not a parameter: when it equals
`dobot_cr3a` (injected by the CR3A launch file via `additional_env`), `configure`
runs the CR3A gripper power-up sequence (`SetOutByte(28, 113)`, then a readback of
output byte 28 and input bit 0.1). Any other value skips it with an INFO log.

## Topics, actions and services

| Name (deployment default) | Dir | Type | QoS | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/movensys_manipulator_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory` | action server | `control_msgs/FollowJointTrajectory` | action default | per goal | Name from `joint_trajectory_action`. Goals are **rejected** unless the node is `active`; accepted goals run `ACCEPT_AND_EXECUTE` on a detached thread. |
| `/movensys_manipulator_arm_controller/joint_trajectory` | sub | `trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory` | default, depth 1 | producer | Name from `joint_trajectory_topic`. Only the **last point** of each message is used — this is a streaming target, not a queued trajectory. |
| `/moveit2_trajectory/execution_active` | pub (JTC) / sub (JPC) | `std_msgs/Bool` | **transient_local**, depth 1 | on change | Arbitration latch: `true` for the duration of a planned goal. Latched so a controller that joins late sees the current state. |
| `/servo_node/delta_joint_cmds` | pub (JTC) | `control_msgs/JointJog` | default, depth 10 | on goal exit | Zero-velocity jog for the goal's joint names, published on *every* exit path (success, abort, cancel) so MoveIt Servo does not resume with a stale delta. Hardcoded, not a parameter. |
| `/joint_states` | pub | `sensor_msgs/JointState` | default, depth 1 | `joint_feedback_rate` | Name from `encoder_joint_topic`. `name` = `joint_name` + `gripper_joint_name`; `position`/`velocity` = `actualPos`/`actualVelocity`; no `effort`. Header stamped from the node clock. |
| `/isaacsim/joint_command` | pub | `sensor_msgs/JointState` | default, depth 1 | `joint_feedback_rate` | Same content, **zero header stamp** (published before stamping). |
| `/gazebo_position_controller/commands` | pub | `std_msgs/Float64MultiArray` | default, depth 1 | `joint_feedback_rate` | `data` = the position vector above (joints then gripper). |
| `/wmx/set_gripper` | service | `std_srvs/SetBool` | services QoS | on call | Name from `wmx_gripper_topic`. `data: true` = close (bit 1), `false` = open (bit 0). Returns `success: false` when the node is not `active`. |
| `wmx/axes/clear_amp_alarm`, `wmx/axes/set_servo_on` | client (broadcaster) | `wmx_r2_message/SetAxes` | services QoS | at activate | Served by `wmx_core_motion_node`. See the lifecycle section. |
| `wmx/engine/get_axis_param` | client (broadcaster) | `wmx_r2_message/GetAxisParam` | services QoS | at configure | Served by `wmx_engine_node`. The dump for `joint_axes` is logged at INFO so the axis setup is captured in the startup log; a missing engine service only warns, configuration still succeeds. |

**Namespaces.** The data-topic defaults resolve to *absolute* names in the shipped
configs, so launching in a ROS namespace does **not** namespace them — override the
topic/action parameters explicitly for multi-robot deployments. The lifecycle
services (`~/change_state`, `~/get_state`) do follow the namespace; the lifecycle
manager discovers each node under its fully-qualified name, and
`wmx/lifecycle/set_node_state` takes that same name.

---

## Units and conventions

- Joint values are passed through **unconverted**: `JointState.position` is the raw
  WMX `actualPos`, and a goal position is written straight into the spline /
  interpolation command. The WMX axis user-unit scaling (encoder counts, gear
  ratio) must be configured WMX-side — via the axis parameter XML — so that one
  axis user unit = 1 rad at the joint, matching the URDF. There is no gear-ratio
  or offset parameter in any of these nodes.
- Velocity feedback is the servo's `actualVelocity` (same user unit per second),
  not a numerical derivative of position.
- `joint_trajectory_controller` is **time-based**: it consumes `positions` and
  `time_from_start` only. `velocities` and `accelerations` in the goal are logged
  and discarded — the WMX C-spline derives the profile from the position/time
  sequence. `time_from_start` is converted to milliseconds; the first point is
  forced to `t = 0`, and a final point less than 1 ms after its predecessor is
  dropped (planners routinely emit such a duplicate endpoint).
- `joint_position_controller` is **step-based**: per axis, `velocity = |target −
  posCmd| / dt` and `acc = dec = velocity / (accel_ratio · dt)`, where `dt` is the
  point's `time_from_start`. Because every axis gets its own velocity for a shared
  `dt`, `StartLinearIntplPos` makes them all arrive at the same instant. The step
  is measured against the **commanded** position (`posCmd`), not the encoder, so
  following error does not feed back into the next command.
- Gripper state is a single IO **bit**, so feedback is two-valued: the broadcaster
  reports `gripper_close_value` or `gripper_open_value`, never anything between.

---

## Lifecycle and runtime behaviour

**Startup.** All four are managed (lifecycle) nodes. They start `unconfigured` and
do nothing until `wmx_lifecycle_manager_node` drives them — automatically once
`wmx_engine_node` reports `Communicating`, or on demand through
`wmx/lifecycle/set_node_state` / `ros2 lifecycle set`. The manipulator configs list
them in `managed_nodes` **after** the device-level nodes, so
`wmx_core_motion_node` is already active and serving `wmx/axes/*` by the time the
broadcaster activates and calls it.

`on_configure` is the same shape everywhere:

1. `CreateDevice(WMX3_SDK_PATH, DeviceTypeNormal, 10 s)` — any error fails the
   transition and leaves the node `unconfigured` (the manager logs it and retries
   on the next discovery sweep).
2. `SetDeviceName("<node name>")`.
3. Build the API wrappers (`CoreMotion`, plus `AdvancedMotion` +
   `CreateSplineBuffer(0, 1000)` for the trajectory controller, `IO` for the
   broadcaster and gripper).
4. Create the publishers / subscriptions / action server / service, with any timer
   created stopped.

Per-node activation:

- **`joint_state_broadcaster`** — `on_configure` reads `wmx/engine/get_axis_param`
  for its `joint_axes` and logs the dump (informational: a failure only warns).
  `on_activate` is the only place in the stack that touches servo power. It calls `wmx/axes/clear_amp_alarm` then
  `wmx/axes/set_servo_on` for every `joint_axes` entry, with up to 5 attempts
  (10 s service wait, 15 s per call, 2 s backoff when the server answers "not
  active" / "not initialized"); a hard failure fails the transition and leaves the
  node `inactive`. Only then does the feedback timer start. `on_deactivate` stops
  the timer and switches the servos **off** directly through CoreMotion — so
  deactivating the broadcaster drops the arm's holding torque.
- **`joint_trajectory_controller`** — `on_activate` publishes
  `execution_active: false` and starts accepting goals. `on_deactivate` republishes
  `false` and rejects further goals; a goal already running on its detached thread
  is not interrupted.
- **`joint_position_controller`** — `on_activate` just arms the callback.
  `on_deactivate` issues `Stop` + `Wait` on all `joint_axes`, so the streaming path
  never leaves an interpolation running behind it.
- **`gripper_controller`** — `on_activate`/`on_deactivate` only flip the gate that
  the service checks; the output bit is left as-is.

`on_cleanup` drops the interfaces and closes the WMX device in every node;
`on_shutdown` delegates to `on_cleanup`. A failed `configure` is not terminal: the
node stays alive and `unconfigured`, and the transition is retried on the next
sweep. No node exits with an error code on init failure — supervise via logs,
lifecycle state, or topic liveness (`/joint_states` at `joint_feedback_rate`), not
exit codes.

**Manual vs. controller arbitration.** `wmx_core_motion_node` refuses its own motion
commands (`start_pos`, `start_mov`, `start_vel`, `start_jog`, `start_home`) while any
node in its `motion_controllers` list is ACTIVE, so a manual jog cannot fight a running
controller. `wmx/axes/stop` is never blocked, and the servo/config services stay open —
the broadcaster needs `set_servo_on` to activate. See `reference_general_nodes.md`.

**Planned vs. streamed arbitration.** Both motion controllers can command the same
axes, so they interlock over `/moveit2_trajectory/execution_active`:

1. A `FollowJointTrajectory` goal publishes `true` on entry.
2. `joint_position_controller` latches that and drops every incoming streamed
   trajectory while it holds.
3. On exit (success, abort, or cancel) the trajectory controller publishes `false`
   and sends a zero `JointJog` to `/servo_node/delta_joint_cmds`.

The latch is one-directional: a servo motion already in flight is not preempted
when a planned goal starts. Keep MoveIt Servo paused (or accept that the first
planned goal wins the race) if both can be commanded at once.

**Goal execution** (`joint_trajectory_controller`, on a detached thread):

1. Reject if `points.size() > 1000` (abort, no motion).
2. Fill the spline buffer from `positions` + `time_from_start`, normalize the first
   timestamp to 0, drop a sub-millisecond final point.
3. `StartCSplinePos(buffer 0, ...)`; a WMX error aborts the goal with
   `result.error_code` set to the raw WMX code.
4. Poll every 10 ms until `inPos` is set on every `joint_axes` entry, or the goal is
   canceled — cancel issues `Stop` + `Wait` and reports `canceled`.

No feedback messages are published during execution, and there is no path
tolerance / goal tolerance check: `inPos` (WMX-side, from the axis parameters) is
the completion criterion.

**Process model.** Each node ships as its own executable, one process per node.
`joint_state_broadcaster` runs on a `MultiThreadedExecutor` (its activate-time
service calls need it); the other three run on the default single-threaded
executor, with the trajectory controller's goal execution on a detached thread it
manages itself. None is built as a composable component.

---

## Known limitations

- **Goal shape is trusted.** The trajectory controller reads `positions.at(j)` for
  every configured axis. A goal with fewer positions than `joint_axes` throws
  inside the detached execution thread, which terminates the process. Constrain
  this at the planner/config layer.
- **Names are positional.** Neither `joint_axes` ↔ goal `joint_names` (trajectory
  controller) nor `joint_name` ↔ `joint_axes` (broadcaster) is length-checked; a
  mismatch is silent misordering or out-of-bounds access, not an error.
- **No engine gate in the feedback loop.** `publishJointState()` does not check the
  engine state or the `GetStatus` return, so while the engine is down the
  broadcaster keeps publishing the last values it read. Watch the engine through
  `wmx/engine/get_engine_status` (the lifecycle manager already does, and takes
  these nodes down when it stops).
- **`gripper_controller` hardcodes its SDK path.** It calls `CreateDevice("/opt/lmx/", ...)`
  rather than the compiled-in `WMX3_SDK_PATH` that every other node uses; an
  installation elsewhere fails to configure this node only.
- **CR3A gripper setup is model-gated by environment.** Running
  `gripper_controller` outside its launch file (no `MANIPULATOR_MODEL`) skips the
  power-up sequence, and the service then toggles a bit on an unpowered gripper.

---

## Configuration files

A deployment is one YAML plus the launch wiring
(example: `launch/wmx_r2_cr3a_manipulator.launch.py`):

1. **ROS parameter YAML** — `config/cr3a_manipulator_config.yaml` (or
   `cr5a_...`), with one key per node (all tables above) **plus** the
   `wmx_engine_node` and `wmx_lifecycle_manager_node` keys: the manipulator launch
   passes this same file down to the included general-nodes launch as
   `config_file`, so engine core/affinity (`core`, `affinity_mask`), the WMX
   parameter XML path (`wmx_param_file_path`), and the bring-up order all live
   in it.
2. **WMX parameter XML** — `config/cr3a_wmx_parameters.xml`: axis-level
   gear/feedback/limit/`inPos` setup. This is where the "axis user unit = joint
   rad" scaling and the hardware-level motion limits live. Loaded by
   `wmx_engine_node` via `wmx_param_file_path`, or on demand through
   `wmx/engine/import_and_set_all`.
3. **Launch** — includes the general nodes, then starts the manipulator nodes as
   `LifecycleNode`s (unconfigured; the manager drives them) and injects
   `use_sim_time` and, for CR3A, `MANIPULATOR_MODEL=dobot_cr3a`.

```yaml

      - joint_state_broadcaster
      - joint_trajectory_controller
      - joint_position_controller
      - gripper_controller
```

The action name is also the MoveIt2 integration point: it must match the
controller name in the MoveIt controllers YAML on the planning side.

## Toolkit integration checklist

What the Toolkit needs to template per robot / per deployment:

- **Always per robot:** `joint_axes` and `joint_name` (identical lists across the
  three motion nodes), `joint_feedback_rate`, and the WMX parameter XML
  (`wmx_param_file_path`) that defines the joint unit scaling and limits.
- **Per gripper:** `gripper_address`, `gripper_open_value`/`gripper_close_value`,
  `gripper_joint_name`, `wmx_gripper_topic` — and drop `gripper_controller` from
  `managed_nodes` entirely on grippersless arms (CR5A).
- **Per planning stack:** `joint_trajectory_action` and `joint_trajectory_topic`,
  which must match the MoveIt2 controller configuration and the Servo output topic.
- **Usually defaults:** `accel_ratio`, `default_velocity`, `min_step`, and the
  simulator mirror topics (leave them at the shipped values unless Isaac/Gazebo is
  in the loop).
- **Not parameterized (by design):** the lifecycle gate
  (`wmx_lifecycle_manager_node` owns it), the arbitration topic
  `/moveit2_trajectory/execution_active` and servo reset topic
  `/servo_node/delta_joint_cmds`, the 1000-point spline buffer size, the
  clear-alarm/servo-on sequence (fixed to activate), and any gear-ratio scaling
  (WMX XML owns it).

## Build

`wmx_r2_package` compiles against the WMX3 SDK at the CMake cache path
`WMX3_SDK_PATH` (default `/opt/wmx3`); the same path (with a trailing `/` appended
by CMake) is compiled in and passed to `CreateDevice` at runtime — except in
`gripper_controller`, which hardcodes `/opt/lmx/`. The trajectory controller
additionally links `advancedmotionapi` for the C-spline path.

At **runtime** the dynamic linker must be able to find the SDK's shared libraries
(`libimdll.so` etc.): either an `ld.so.conf.d` entry for `/opt/wmx3/lib` (the SDK
installer's default) or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/wmx3/lib` — relevant when running in
containers that only mount the SDK.

The manipulator launches need **root** for real-time scheduling; start them with
`sudo --preserve-env` as shown in
[launch_dobot_cr3a_manipulator.md](launch_dobot_cr3a_manipulator.md).

`joint_position_controller` has a launch test
(`test/test_joint_position_controller.py`, no hardware required) exercised by
`colcon test --packages-select wmx_r2_package`. The startup service sequence the
broadcaster depends on is documented in
[reference_general_nodes.md](reference_general_nodes.md).
